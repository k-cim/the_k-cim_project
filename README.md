# The K-Cim Project

**The K-Cim Project** is the unified backbone for all independent software and infrastructure tools designed by K-Cim (Mickaël Puaud).

It hosts and structures multiple modular projects including:

- **DataShard** — Persistent storage, archive & fragmentation tools  
- **GridKeep** — Structured JSON & log manipulation with visual logic  
- **Aetherion** — Decentralized RAID-6-style memory storage chain

This repository acts as a root node, visual anchor, and technical hub for the entire ecosystem.
